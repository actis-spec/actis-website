# ACTIS v1 — Compatibility and Verification Algorithms

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Normative  
**Entrypoint:** [ACTIS_STANDARD_v1.md](./ACTIS_STANDARD_v1.md)

This document defines the normative algorithms for ACTIS v1.0 verification: envelope hash construction, round and transcript hashing, signature verification, and the actis_status decision tree. Implementations MUST follow these algorithms to be conformant.

---

## 1. Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

---

## 2. Envelope Hash Construction

**envelope_hash** is a round-local digest. It is the hash of a canonical JSON serialization of the round’s envelope object. The signature in the round is computed **over** this digest (the 64-character hex string), not over the raw envelope. The envelope object MUST NOT include the signature or the envelope_hash field itself.

### 2.1 Envelope Object (round-local)

The **envelope object** is a JSON object containing only the following round fields, with all other round fields excluded:

**Included (if present in the round):**

- `round_number`
- `round_type`
- `message_hash`
- `timestamp_ms`
- `previous_round_hash`
- `round_hash` (optional in round; include in envelope object only if present in the round)
- `agent_id` (optional; include only if present)
- `public_key_b58` (optional; include only if present)
- `content_summary` (optional; include only if present)

**Excluded:**

- `envelope_hash` — excluded so the digest is not self-referential.
- `signature` — excluded; the signature is over the digest of the envelope, not part of the envelope.

No transcript-level fields (e.g. `transcript_id`, `intent_id`) are part of the envelope. The envelope is round-local only.

### 2.2 Serialization and Digest

1. Build the envelope object from the round by taking only the included keys listed in §2.1 (with the same values as in the round). Omit any key not present in the round.
2. Serialize the envelope object to canonical JSON per RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme, JCS): deterministic key ordering, no unnecessary whitespace, deterministic encoding of numbers and strings. Implementations MUST use an RFC 8785–compliant canonicalizer (or equivalent that produces the same output). Strings MUST be interpreted exactly as encoded in the JSON document without Unicode normalization.
3. Compute SHA-256 over the UTF-8 encoding of the canonical JSON string.
4. Encode the digest as exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (no prefix, no spaces).

**Formula (informative):**

```
envelope_object = { round fields except "envelope_hash" and "signature" }
envelope_hash = to_lower_hex( SHA-256( utf8( canonical_json( envelope_object ) ) ) )
```

### 2.3 Signature Binding

The signer computes `envelope_hash` as above, then signs the **envelope_hash value** (the 64-character hex string) as UTF-8 bytes. The verifier MUST verify the signature against the `envelope_hash` value stored in the round. Verifiers MAY recompute the envelope object from the round (excluding `envelope_hash` and `signature`), compute the digest, and compare it to the round’s `envelope_hash` to detect tampering of envelope fields.

### 2.4 Worked Example (pseudocode)

```
Round (excerpt):
  round_number: 0
  round_type: "INTENT"
  message_hash: "a1b2..."
  envelope_hash: "<to be computed>"
  signature: { ... }   // not part of envelope

Envelope object (input to hash):
  { "message_hash": "a1b2...", "previous_round_hash": "c3d4...", "round_hash": "e5f6...", "round_number": 0, "round_type": "INTENT", "timestamp_ms": 1709500000000 }

Canonical JSON string → SHA-256 → 64 lowercase hex → envelope_hash.
Then: signature = Ed25519_sign( utf8(envelope_hash) ).
```

---

## 3. Round and Transcript Hashing

### 3.1 Round 0 — previous_round_hash (genesis)

For round 0 there is no previous round. The genesis value is:

```
previous_round_hash = to_lower_hex( SHA-256( utf8( intent_id + ":" + created_at_ms ) ) )
```

`intent_id` and `created_at_ms` are the transcript-level values. The string is the concatenation of `intent_id`, the literal character `:`, and the decimal representation of `created_at_ms` (no leading zeros, no JSON wrapping). No Unicode normalization or trimming is applied to `intent_id`.

### 3.2 Round hash (per round)

For each round, the **round_hash** is the SHA-256 digest of the canonical JSON serialization of the round object **excluding the `round_hash` field itself**. RFC 8785 canonicalization MUST be used. The result is 64 lowercase hex characters.

```
round_object_without_hash = round with key "round_hash" removed
round_hash = to_lower_hex( SHA-256( utf8( canonical_json( round_object_without_hash ) ) ) )
```

### 3.3 Chain linkage

For round index `i > 0`, `round[i].previous_round_hash` MUST equal the `round_hash` of round `i-1` (or the digest computed from round `i-1` as in §3.2 if `round_hash` is omitted).

### 3.4 Final hash (transcript)

The **final_hash** of the transcript is the SHA-256 digest of the canonical JSON serialization of the **entire transcript object excluding the `final_hash` field**. The `model_context` field (if present) is excluded from the object before serialization so that MRM metadata does not affect determinism. RFC 8785 MUST be used. The result is 64 lowercase hex.

```
transcript_for_hash = transcript with "final_hash" and "model_context" removed
final_hash = to_lower_hex( SHA-256( utf8( canonical_json( transcript_for_hash ) ) ) )
```

## 4. Signature Verification

- **Scheme:** ACTIS v1.0 supports Ed25519 only. The signature is a detached Ed25519 signature.
- **Message signed:** The `envelope_hash` value (64 lowercase hex characters) encoded as UTF-8 bytes. No `0x` prefix, no spaces.
- **Verification:** The verifier MUST decode `signature.signer_public_key_b58` and `signature.signature_b58` (Base58), decode `envelope_hash` as hex to bytes, and verify that the signature is valid for the public key over the envelope_hash bytes. If the round’s `public_key_b58` is present, it MUST match `signature.signer_public_key_b58` for the round to be considered valid.

---

## 5. Manifest and Bundle Rules

**Manifest:** The bundle MUST contain a `manifest.json` at the root (or path declared in the bundle format). The manifest MUST include a `core_files` array: relative paths, unique, forward slashes, no `../`, no absolute or drive paths. The minimal ACTIS core set is `["checksums.sha256", "manifest.json", "input/transcript.json"]`. See [ACTIS_AUDITOR_PACK.md](./ACTIS_AUDITOR_PACK.md) §2 and schema [actis/schemas/actis_manifest_v1.json](../schemas/actis_manifest_v1.json). The checksum file (e.g. `checksums.sha256`) MUST NOT list itself; it lists the other core files only.

**Bundle security:**

- Checksums apply only to paths listed in `core_files`. Only those paths are in the ACTIS verification surface. Unlisted files MUST NOT affect actis_status; verifiers SHOULD warn when unlisted files are present.
- Core file paths in the manifest MUST be unique. Duplicate archive entries for the same core path MUST result in ACTIS_NONCOMPLIANT. Symlinks for core paths MUST be rejected. Path traversal (e.g. `../`, absolute paths, drive prefixes) in core paths MUST be rejected.
- ACTIS_COMPATIBLE means the verified core surface (transcript, hash chain, signatures, listed checksums) is intact. It does not imply that the entire archive is safe to execute or trust beyond that surface. Verifiers MAY add a warning (e.g. in `warnings`) when unlisted or suspicious entries are present.

---

## 6. actis_status Decision Tree

Verification MUST derive **actis_status** from the following (and only the following) checks:

1. **Schema/layout:** Transcript conforms to schema; required fields present; bundle layout valid; manifest core files present and unique; no duplicate core path entries; no symlinks or path traversal for core paths.
2. **Hash chain:** All round hashes and previous_round_hash linkage valid; final_hash (if present) matches recomputation.
3. **Checksums:** All core files listed in manifest match checksums (if checksum file present).
4. **Signatures:** All rounds have valid Ed25519 signatures over the round’s envelope_hash.

**ACTIS_COMPATIBLE:** All of (1)–(4) pass.

**ACTIS_PARTIAL:** (1), (2), and (3) pass; one or more signatures missing or invalid. No other failure.

**ACTIS_NONCOMPLIANT:** Any of (1)–(3) fail, or any failure other than signature-only.

Implementations MUST NOT use blame, reputation, risk, or settlement to determine actis_status. Only the checks above are normative.
